# covid-19-network-embeddings

We constructed network embeddings for COVID-19 by applying the node2vec model over a co-occurrence network derived from the CORD-19-on-FHIR datasets.

## Visualization

The network is visualized using [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) and is available
[here: https://www.davidoniani.com/covid-19-network](https://www.davidoniani.com/covid-19-network).
